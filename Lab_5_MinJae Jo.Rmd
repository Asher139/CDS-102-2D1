### Exercise 1
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
towed_renamed <- towed %>%
  rename(
    tow_date          = `Tow Date`,
    make              = Make,
    style             = Style,
    model             = Model,
    color             = Color,

    inventory_number  = `Inventory Number`
  )

colnames(towed_renamed)
```


### Exercise 2

```{r}
library(lubridate)

towed_renamed_2 <- towed_renamed %>%
  mutate(tow_date = mdy(tow_date))
str(towed_renamed_2)
class(towed_renamed_2$tow_date)
```



### Exercise 3
```{r}
tow_make_count <- towed_renamed_2 %>%
  count(make)

nrow(tow_make_count)
